"""Machine Party - 8 Player Mod installer.

Patches your own copy of the game in place. Nothing here contains the game's
assets: it reads the .pck you already own, swaps in the mod's files, and writes
the result back.

    python3 install.py              install (auto-detects the game)
    python3 install.py --uninstall  report the state and how to get back
    python3 install.py --game-dir "/path/to/Machine Party_Linux"

No backup is kept: the .pck is patched in place, straight from whatever is
installed right now. Steam's "Verify integrity of game files" is the way back
to the original, and the installer refuses to patch an already-patched .pck
because without a pristine base the result would be wrong either way.
