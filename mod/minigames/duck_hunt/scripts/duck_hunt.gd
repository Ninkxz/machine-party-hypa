# --- 8P MOD ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Duck Hunt is 1 hunter + (N-1) DUCKS, not the "3 duck slots + 1 hunter" this
# mod's notes claimed for months. The hunter is popped from a shuffled pool and
# every remaining player is a duck, so the duck count already scales on its own.
# The only hard blocker was the spawn markers: the scene ships exactly THREE
# under Networked/DuckPlayerSpawner/DuckPlayerSpawnPositions, and spawn_players()
# reads `spawn_positions[counter]`. At five players `counter` reaches 3, the read
# runs off the end, the host's spawn loop aborts before the hunter is created,
# and the scene hangs - the Forklift Certified black-screen failure.
#
# Markers are created HERE, at runtime, gated on roster > 4 - never in the
# .tscn. That matters more than usual: the marker list is shuffle()d, so baking
# extras into the scene would let a 4-player game seat ducks on modded
# positions, which is the pre-existing deviation UPDATING.md documents for the
# other fifteen scenes. Creating them only above four means 1-4 sees the shipped
# three and nothing else, and Duck Hunt sidesteps that deviation entirely.
#
# Host-only is sufficient: clients never see a marker, only the position it
# resolves to, via `teleport_rpc.rpc(spawn_positions[counter].global_position)`.
#
# Placement keeps the shipped three exactly (x = -5, 0, +5 at z = 104) and
# interleaves up to four more at HALF the shipped spacing, alternating outward:
# x = +/-2.5 then +/-7.5. All seven sit on the same z, so every duck runs the
# same distance - a staggered second row would hand the front row a real head
# start over the 134-unit course.
#
# The span stays inside the FinishArea's half-width. That box is 23.5 x 7 x 5.5
# (duck_hunt.tscn), so +/-11.75 is provably traversable - every duck has to pass
# through it. Do not extend past it; the outer markers would start outside the
# finish corridor. The trace prints each x and flags anything outside.

# --- 8P MOD: `-startgame` leaves Duck Hunt permanently unplayable -------------
# `shared/states/round_state.gd` short-circuits Round -> Countdown whenever
# Globals.debug_skip_brief is set, skipping the RoleReveal state. That state is
# NOT purely presentational, which is what made this so easy to misread:
# `role_reveal_state.gd` holds the ONLY online call to
# `hunter_player.set_can_aim_rpc(true)` and `can_aim` defaults to false. (The
# other set_can_aim_rpc(true), in hunter_player.reveal_role(), is reached only
# from reveal_local() - the local-couch path, which this mod does not use.)
#
# So on the fast path the hunter can never aim or fire; no duck ever dies;
# check_game_end() never gets past `if not duck_players.is_empty() and
# hunter_player: return`; and there is no turn timer to break the deadlock. The
# minigame hangs forever. Measured 2026-08-05: 240s at 8 players sitting in Play
# with zero further state transitions. Duck Hunt is 4th in the rotation, so this
# also hung every START=1 rotation run before it could reach the other nine.
#
# It went unnoticed for three days because every START=1 run was killed by
# localtest.sh's duration long before anything needed Duck Hunt to *finish* -
# the traces fired at scene load and the session died. See UPDATING.md,
# "START=1 HANGS Duck Hunt permanently".
#
# This re-does exactly what the skipped state would have done, and only while
# the skip is active. A real session never sets debug_skip_brief, so 1-4 vanilla
# behaviour is untouched (rule 3). Called from the end of spawn_players(), which
# reset_state.gd re-runs for EVERY hunter turn - so each new hunter gets its aim
